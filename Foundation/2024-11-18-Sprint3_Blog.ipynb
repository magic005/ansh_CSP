    "\n",
    "I was able to conceptually understand how the front end and back ends work, as well as gained the knowledge needed to impliment a genuine, relevant social media site with real-world application\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the accomplishment I am most proud of is understanding how to create a running backend on our site, meaning our front-end could successfully communicate with the backend."
